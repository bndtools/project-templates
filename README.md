# What is this Repo?

This repository is the home for the sources of some useful Bndtools Project Templates. These are provided as bundles which you can include in your workspace to add new project templates.

# How do I use these?

You can add the template bundles to any repository in your workspace, but if you use the [Bndtools Workspace Template](https://github.com/bndtools/workspace) then they're included by default.
